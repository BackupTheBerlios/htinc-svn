		 HTML Include
		 ============

HTML Include handles Include files in HTML Source files. It checks
the given source file for certain Tags (special-styled comments) and
replaces the content of the include area when the associated file
was changed.
Besides handling includes, HTML Include also updates special Date Tags
with the current date. Convenient for "last modification" lines.

The full user manual is 'doc/htinc.txt'
