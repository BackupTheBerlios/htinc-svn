			     HTML Include
			     ============
			     Version 0.20




			  Short Description
			  *****************

HTML Include solves the problem that the Hypertext Markup Language doesn't
knows a command for including other files into a source file.
So if you use some pieces of source code (i. e. Hypertext fractions) in
more than one file, then you need to copy the piece into every single file.
And if you change something, then you have to manually modify all files.
But now you can delegate this task to HTML Include, which checks
the given source file for certain Tags (special-styled comments) and
replaces the content of the include area, if the content in the
associated include file was changed.
As a bonus, it also writes the current date to the "last
modification" line which you usually forget (or do not bother) to update.

			Building HTML Include
			*********************

See the separate file titled INSTALL. HTML Include uses
autoconf/automake. So in short, you just have to type
in the root directory

'./configure'	      followed by

'make'		      and

'make install'	      to configure, build and install the package.

The installation directory and several other things can be changed at
the run of configure. Just issue './configure --help' to get a list of
all the things you want (or maybe don't want) to know.

If you do not want to install the whole package just copy the
executable "src/htinc" (and maybe the documentation files under doc/)
to any location you like.


		       Usage and Tag Structure
		       ***********************

Call HTML Include with the file(s) to process, optionally specify a
different include search path. The program then scans the input files
and performs both include and date updates.

The file portions to repace are marked with so-called Tags, which are
embedded in the file. Tags can require a parameter, e.g. the
include file name for Include Tags.
The basic structure is the following:
----------------------------
random file text
<STARTTAG><optional_parameter><STARTTAGEND>
Inserted Text
<ENDTAG>
random file text
----------------------------

Tags can appear anywhere in the text, not necessarily on separate
lines. Thus, the following is also a valid embedded block:
----------------------------
random file text
random file text<STARTTAG><optional_parameter><STARTTAGEND>Inserted Text
Inserted Text
§Inserted Text<ENDTAG>random file text
random file text
----------------------------


The following sections explain both implemented tag types:
Include Tags and Date Tags
Currently always both tags are updated, there is not way to disable
one method. But this is fast to implement, when somebody requests it.


			     Include Tags
			     ************

Purpose: Include other files

Parameter: Required, Include file name
The include file is searched in the include directory specified on the
command line. The path is interpreted relative to the directory where HTML
Include was called from.

Content: Content of the include file

Format: Example follows
----------------------------
<!--INCLUDE="body.inc"-->
the content from body.inc will be inserted here
<!--ENDINC-->
----------------------------
The Start Tag consist of two parts: '<--INCLUDE="' and '"-->'
If this two parts are found then the text between them is parsed
as the name of the include file (here: 'body.inc').
The include file is finished by the End Tag: '<!--ENDINC-->'

Notes:
It is of course possible to use paths (relative to the Include Directory)
as Include Names, if one want to structure the used Include files over
several directories.
Nesting include files (i.e. Tags inside include files) is not supported.


			      Date Tags
			      *********

Purpose: Update Date

Parameter: None

Content: Current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD

Format, Normal: Example follows
----------------------------
<!--INCLUDEDATE-->2006-05-03<!--ENDINC-->
----------------------------
The Start Tag is '<!--INCLUDEDATE-->' and
the End Tag '<!--ENDINC-->'
Between both tags the current date is inserted.

Format, Meta: Example follows
----------------------------
<meta name="date" content="2006-05-03">
----------------------------
Beside the user defined tag from above also the meta line for browers
is updated. Here the Start Tag is '<meta name="date" content="' and
the End Tag '">'


			   Program Options
			   ***************

Usage: htinc [-h|-V] [-i include_dir] {-q} {-d} filenames

filenames: The source file(s) which should be processed
 
--usage: Short usage message
 
-?/--help: Show the help screen and exit

-V/--version: Print version and exit

-q/-quiet: Print only error messages

-d/-debug: Enable debug messages

-i/--include include_dir: Directory (relative to current directory) where
	  the include files should be searched.
          The default directory is "include/"


Example: "htinc index.html -i ../includes"

This would process the source file index.html and look for Include files
in the directory "../includes".
Assume one include file is named "copyrigt.inc". Then the program
would try to open the file "../includes/copyright.inc" from
the current directory (where the program was started, not necessary the
directory where the source file is located).
In the same run also all date tags are updated to the current date.


			     Return Codes
			     ************

This are the Exit codes returned by HTML Include.

    0: No Errors
    1: Wrong command line parameters or options
    2: Error opening a file (source file or include file)
    3: Bad file (source file or include file)
    4: Start Tag lacks an include file name
   99: Internal (i. e. unexpected) error


			  Tricks, no Treats
			  *****************

If you want to use other Tag names then just edit the file 'main.h'
to suit your needs before compiling HTML Include.

subversion repository.

The idea of the Include file handling orginates from the program

'IDE' for editing Hypertext Markup code.
