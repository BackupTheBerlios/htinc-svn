- The line number printed in the message
  "Updated date entry in line XX" is wrong when in include files
  the number of newline characters has changed
  - Source: The linenum object is implemented in that way that
    it prints the line number from the original file. When HTML
    include aborts (does not change the file) then the error is
    found in the correct line. This implementation is not valid
    anymore when the file is successfully processed.
