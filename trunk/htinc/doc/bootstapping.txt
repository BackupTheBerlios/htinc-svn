Bootstrapping from Subversion
*****************************

If you're compiling HTML Include from the subversion repository, you
need to have the autoconf/automake tools at hand.
Then just enter the root directory (where the file 'configure.ac'
is located) and type 'autoreconf'. This should run all necessary tools
in the right order to generate the configure-script and the
Makefiles's.
I am using autoconf 2.59 and automake 1.9.5, but most usually other
versions will also suffice.

If you have problems bootstrapping (or at any other point), please
