<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>HTML Include solves the problem that the Hypertext Markup Language doesn't
know a command for including other files into a source file.
So if you use some pieces of source code (i. e. Hypertext fractions) in
more than one file, you need to copy the piece into every single file.
And if you change something you'll manually have to modify all files.
But now you can delegate this task to HTML Include, which checks
the given source file for certain Tags (special-styled comments) and
replaces the content of the include area, when the content in the
associated include file was changed.<br>
As a bonus, it also writes the current date to the "last
modification" line and brower meta, which you usually forget
(or do not bother) to update.<br>

	HTML Include documentation.</span></p>

<p>If you want to see an example, just examine this page in any text
      editor and look for comments with the text &quot;INCLUDE&quot;,
      &quot;INCLUDEDATE&quot; and
      &quot;ENDINC&quot; in them. You can also see the content of the <a
	href="include/">included</a> files and the <a
	href="run_htinc.sh">run-script</a> for HTML Include.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/htinc/trunk/htinc/doc/htinc.txt">full documentation</a>
is available in the Subversion repository. Please note that this version is possibly
newer than the latest release.</p>

<h2>Who would need this?</h2>

<p>From the author's point of view HTML Include is of good use for people
who have their own plain-HTML web pages, which they also change from
time to time. They would use an text editor instead of an Web
Development System which probably already implement the features
HTML Include provides.

<p>Of course HTML Include cannot compete with a full
grown Content Management System, but on the other hand is mastered
in half an hour.<br>
And it allows you to reuse code in multiple files as well as
keep the modification date up-to-date.</p>


<h2>Get it from BerliOS!</h2>

<p>
The HTML Include project page is hosted at BerliOS:
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/htinc/">
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/htinc/</a>.
There you can find further information and download
      the latest release.</p>

<p>Also a <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/htinc/">Freshmeat record</a>
for HTML Include is available.</p>

<h2>How to retrieve HTML Include from SVN</h2>

<p>HTML Include is developed using the Subversion repository of
      BerliOS (therefore you cannot find any files in the CVS-area of
      this project, in case you wondered). Subversion is a version
      control system designed to be superior and eventually replace
      CVS. Their home page is located at
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">http://subversion.tigris.org</a>
      in case you want to find out more about it.</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve the latest developer version of HTML
      Include, here is the instruction how to get it from the
      Subversion repository:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Type the following:
<BR><B><I>svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/htinc/trunk/htinc</I></B>
</li>
<LI>After initial checkout, you can change into this directory and execute
SVN commands without the URL. For example:
<BR>
<B><I>svn status</I></B></li>
</UL>
