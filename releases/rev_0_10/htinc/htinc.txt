			 HTML Include
			 ============
			 Version 0.10


		      Short Description
		      *****************

HTML Include solves the problem that the Hypertext Markup Language doesn't
know a command for including other files into a source file.
So if use some pieces of source code (i. e. Hypertext fractions)
in more than one file than you need to copy the piece into every single file.
And if you change something, than you have to manually modify all files
(that is, if you do not have any type of special editor which handles
this for you).
But now you can delegate this task to HTML Include which checks
the given source file for certain Tags (special-styled comments) and
replace the content of the include area, if the content in the
associated include file was changed.

		     Building HTML Include
		     *********************

For Linux or DJGPP (see credits) the compilation can be started by simply
typing 'make' (only if the appropiate files are present, of course).
The Environment will be autmatically  determined by the return from the
'uname' command: Linux for 'Linux', otherwise DJGPP.


Target Names:
Other targets are issued by typing 'make targetname', e. g. 'make opt'.

debug: build HTML Include with Debug-Support
opt: build HTML Include with optimization and strips it
install: installs HTML Include
	 installation dir: Linux - ~/bin/
		           DJGPP - C:/dienst/
clean: removes object files
bakclean: removes object files and the backup files
ultraclean: removes object files, backup files and the result file


Programs needed for building HTML Include:  make, bash, GCC version 3
If you want to use the targets 'clean', 'bakclean' or 'ultraclean': rm
And for the target 'install': cp

If you are familiar with the matter, then you can customize most of make's
behavior by modifying the file 'Makefile.def'.



		    How to use HTML Include
		    ***********************

HTML Include needs two arguments: the name of the source file and the
include directory, where the Include files should be searched.
Assume you want to update the file 'introduction.html' and your
include files are located in a sub-directory called 'inc_files'.
Then the call for HTML Include would be as following:
"htinc -i inc_files/ introduction.html"
Keep in mind that in this case the program has to be started from the
directoy containing the source file, because the Include directory is
assumed relative to the current directory and not the directory
containing the source file.
Another point is that one cannot emit the trailing slash in 
'inc_files/' because HTML Include only takes this include directory and
the include file name (as in the source file), concatenate them both
and then opens the resulting file.


			     The Tags
			     ********

Now we can start HTML Include, but the structure of the source files
is still unclear:

Every single Include in the source file is embraced by a set of tags:
HTML Comments of an defined format.
At the beginning (i. e. before the include file) stands the Start Tag
and after the Include's content stands the End Tag.

Here is a very short example of an source file with an Include:
----------------------------
<!--INCLUDE="body.inc"-->
the content stands here
<!--ENDINC-->
----------------------------

The Start Tag consist of two parts: '<--INCLUDE="' and '"-->'
If this two parts are found then the text between them is parsed
as the name of the include file (here: 'body.inc').
The include file is finished by the End Tag: '<!--ENDINC-->'

Some remarks:
- The Tags have to stand on separate lines
- No modifications (e. g. inserted spaces, other spelling) are allowed
- Every Include file need a Start Tag and an End Tag
- No nesting of include files is supported; e. g. this is not allowed
  (or will at least not work as intended):
----------------------------
<!--INCLUDE="html_skeleton.inc"-->
Header
<!--INCLUDE="body.inc"-->
  Body's content
<!--ENDINC-->
End of Header
<!--ENDINC-->
----------------------------



		       Tricks, no Treats
		       *****************

It is of course possible to use paths (relative to the Include Directory
given on the command line) as Include Names, if one want to structure
the used Include files over several directories.

If you want to use other Tags formats, then just edit the file 'main.h'
to suit your needs before compiling HTML Include.


			Program Options
			***************

Usage: htinc [filename|-h|-v] -i include_dir {-q}


filename: the source file which should be processed

-h/--help: shows the help screen and exits

-v/--version: prints version and exits

-q/-quiet: prints only error messages

-d/-debug: enable debug messages

-i/-inc include_dir: directory (relative to current directory) where
	  the include files should be searched (with slash at the end)


Example: "htinc index.html -i ../includes/"
This would process the source file index.html and look for Include files
in the directory "../includes". E.g. one include file is named "copyrigt.inc".
Then the program would try to open the file "../includes/copyright.inc" from
the current directory (where the program was started, not necessary the
directory where the source file is located).


				Return Codes
				************

This are the Exit-Codes returned by HTML Include.

    0: No Errors
    1: wrong command line parameters or options
    2: error opening a file (source file or include file)
    3: bad file (source file or include file)
    4: Start Tag lacks an include file name
   99: internal (i. e. unexpected) error
